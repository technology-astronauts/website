*Software* Put us to work on your software projects. We
deliver quality software while keeping an eye on scope and maintainability. We
want the users to be happy users.

*Server Environments* We develop server environments that
are low maintenance. We use technologies like ZFS and KVM(Kernel-based Virtual
Machine) to make your data center rock solid. The best documentation is
executable code â€“ we deliver a fully self-describing system that can be
replicated to new hardware.

*Cloud Hosting* We can help you move part or all your services
to the cloud. Even to a private corner of the cloud. 

*Coaching & Consulting* We have over 10 years of experience
with sustainable software development. Starting off with a simple conversation
we find areas where we can help improve your current practices.

*On every scale* Do you need a mobile application? Or a web
application? Are you creating a web of distributed applications that process
data? Machine learning? Do you want to give your business a human interface?
We want to help.

*You can rely on us* We keep deadlines. We stick to our agreements. The value we deliver to you motivates our work.
