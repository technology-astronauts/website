*Software* ° Put us to work on your software projects. We deliver quality
software while keeping an eye on scope and maintainability. We want the users
to be happy users.

*Server Environments* ° We develop server environments that are low
maintenance. We use technologies like ZFS and KVM to make your data center 
rock solid. The best documentation is executable code – we deliver a fully 
self-describing system that can be replicated to new hardware. 

*Coaching & Consulting* ° We have over 10 years of experience with sustainable
software development. Want to talk to us about what you're doing and what 
problems you're facing?

*On every scale* ° Do you need a mobile application? Or a web application? Are
you creating a web of distributed applications that process data? Machine
learning? Do you want to give your business a human interface? We want to help.
