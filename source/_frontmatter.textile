We're a small team of engineers. We like to provide good solutions. We like
doing things that last. We don't like the hidden cost. We like no-bullshit
quality software. Here are areas we will work in:  

* architecture & code
* operations design & implementation
* big and small - from web scale to mobile
* consulting & coaching
