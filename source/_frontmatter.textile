*Software* Put us to work on your software projects. We
deliver quality software while keeping an eye on scope and maintainability. We
want the users to be happy users.

*Server Environments* We develop server environments that are low maintenance.
We use technologies like ZFS, KVM(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and Docker to
make your data center rock solid. Our monitoring helps keep your servers
running.  We automate daily tasks until your mind is free for work again.

*Coaching & Consulting* We have over 10 years of experience
with sustainable software development. Starting off with a simple conversation
we find areas where we can help improve your current practices.

*On every scale* Do you need a mobile application? Or a web
application? Are you creating a web of distributed applications that process
data? Machine learning? Do you want to give your business a human interface?
We want to help.

*You can rely on us* We keep deadlines. We stick to our agreements. The value we
deliver to you motivates our work. We remember what agility was all about.
